        // In a typical setup, your main React app (index.js) would handle routing.
        // For this specific Razor Page, we'll ensure the React app is mounted correctly.
        // This assumes your React app is set up to render based on the URL path.
        // For example, if you navigate to /admin/blog, your React Router should pick up /admin/blog route.

        // You might need to adjust your ClientApp/src/index.js or App.js
        // to ensure it can be mounted to a specific DOM element and handles its own routing.
        // For simplicity, we assume the main React app will handle the routing for /admin/blog
        // when it's loaded.

        // If your React app is not set up to be mounted this way, you might need to
        // create a specific entry point for the admin blog section in your React app
        // and load it here.

        // For now, this Razor Page simply provides the container for the React app.
        // The actual rendering logic is handled by the React app's main entry point (e.g., index.js).
